## Assignment Overview
What is the assignment about?  

The main objective of the assignment is to gain experience with various applications using Linked Lists and stacks and queues. The program in Q1 is designed to mimic a car dealership system. It prompts the user to choose an action to perform and takes proper input depending on the user's choice of action. Then after an action is performed the program updates the data files containing the contents of each linked list and its nodes. Q2 utilises stacks and queues and operations that can be performed on them. The code uses these tools in order to perform mathematical operations on expressions in postfix notation (Reverse Polish Notation) where the operators appear after their operands.

Explain the purpose of the program and what it accomplishes.
